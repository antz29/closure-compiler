#summary Using Internet Explorer's "conditional comments" with Closure Compiler

= Introduction =

Closure Compiler does not natively support Internet Explorer's [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/121hztk3(VS.71).aspx conditional comments], however it is still possible to use them in a limited way.

= Details =

IE's conditional comments can not be used directly, but they can be used in eval conditions.  As an example, one common use of conditional comments is to detect Internet Explorer:
{{{
  var is_ie = /*@cc_on!@*/false;
}}}
This can be rewritten to be compatible with Closure Compiler in this way:
{{{
  var is_ie = eval("/*@cc_on!@*/false");
}}}
The rules for using conditional comments in this way are the same for the use of eval in general.
